## Data Processing Examples

### Quick Analysis with Command Line

View first few orders:
```bash
head -n 5 Retail.OrderHistory.1/Retail.OrderHistory.1.csv
```

Count total orders:
```bash
wc -l Retail.OrderHistory.1/Retail.OrderHistory.1.csv
```

Search for specific product:
```bash
grep "product_name" Retail.OrderHistory.1/Retail.OrderHistory.1.csv
```

### Python Processing Example

```python
import pandas as pd
import os

# Load order history
data_dir = "2025-08-24_amazon_data"
orders_file = os.path.join(data_dir, "Retail.OrderHistory.1", "Retail.OrderHistory.1.csv")
df = pd.read_csv(orders_file)

# Basic analysis
print(f"Total orders: {len(df)}")
print(f"Date range: {df['Order Date'].min()} to {df['Order Date'].max()}")
print(f"Total spent: ${df['Total Price'].sum():.2f}")

# Group by year
df['Year'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Order Date']).dt.year
yearly_spending = df.groupby('Year')['Total Price'].sum()
print(yearly_spending)
```

## Privacy and Security

### Important Considerations

1. **Sensitive Data:**
   - Files contain complete purchase history
   - Includes addresses and payment methods
   - May reveal personal interests and habits

2. **Storage Best Practices:**
   - Store in encrypted directory if possible
   - Never commit to public repositories
   - Add `amazon/data/` to `.gitignore`
   - Delete old exports when no longer needed

3. **Sharing Guidelines:**
   - Never share raw CSV files
   - Anonymize data before sharing insights
   - Be cautious with screenshots

## Regular Updates

### Recommended Frequency

- **Heavy Amazon users:** Quarterly
- **Regular users:** Semi-annually  
- **Light users:** Annually or for tax prep

### Update Process

1. Request new data export
2. Extract to new date-stamped directory
3. Keep 2-3 most recent exports
4. Archive or delete older exports

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem: No email received**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify email address on Amazon account
- Wait full 24 hours before re-requesting

**Problem: Download link expired**
- Links expire after 7 days
- Simply request data again

**Problem: Missing orders**
- Check all CSV files (some orders in different files)
- Verify date range of export
- Some very old orders may not be available

**Problem: CSV parsing errors**
- Ensure UTF-8 encoding when opening
- Use proper CSV libraries (not plain text split)
- Some fields may contain commas (properly quoted)

**Problem: Large file size**
- Extract in stages if needed
- Use command-line tools for processing
- Consider cloud storage for archiving
