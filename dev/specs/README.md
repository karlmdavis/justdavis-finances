# Specifications Format and Style Guide

This guide describes the format and style guidelines for creating specifications in the `dev/specs/` directory.

## Purpose of Specifications

Specifications in this repository serve as **evergreen descriptions** of system goals and desired functionality.
They are living documents that evolve with the project to capture the full range of implemented features.

### Key Principles

1. **Evergreen Documentation**: Specs should describe current system capabilities and goals, not implementation plans or delivery milestones.

2. **Goal-Focused Content**: Focus on what the system should accomplish and why, rather than specific implementation details.

3. **Evolutionary Documents**: Update specs regularly to reflect new features, improvements, and lessons learned from implementation.

4. **Concise Communication**: Aim for clarity and brevity while maintaining comprehensive coverage of functionality.

## Document Structure

Based on existing specifications, follow this recommended structure:

### Required Sections

- **Executive Summary**: Brief overview of the system's purpose and value
- **Problem Statement**: Current pain points and business impact
- **Success Criteria**: Primary goals and measurable outcomes
- **Functional Requirements**: Input requirements, processing requirements, output requirements
- **Technical Architecture**: High-level system design and key components

### Optional Sections

- **Quality Assurance**: Data validation, edge case handling, error recovery
- **Integration Points**: Dependencies and connections to other systems
- **Future Enhancements**: Near-term improvements and advanced features
- **Implementation Verification**: Success validation and performance metrics

### Document Footer

Include standardized document history:

```markdown
---

## Document History

- **YYYY-MM-DD**: Initial specification created
- **Version**: X.Y
- **Status**: [Draft|Complete System Specification|Active Development]
- **Owner**: [Document Owner Name]

---
```

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Content Focus

- **Describe desired outcomes** rather than implementation steps
- **Use present tense** to describe system capabilities
- **Quantify success criteria** with specific metrics where possible
- **Update regularly** to reflect current system state

### Language and Tone

- **Professional and clear**: Use precise technical language
- **Action-oriented**: Focus on what the system does or should do
- **User-focused**: Emphasize business value and user benefits
- **Concise**: Eliminate unnecessary words while maintaining clarity

### Examples

**Good (Goal-focused)**:
> The Amazon Transaction Matching System creates automated linkage between Amazon order history data and corresponding YNAB credit card transactions.

**Avoid (Implementation-focused)**:
> We will implement a Python script that reads CSV files and matches them to YNAB data.

**Good (Measurable)**:
> Achieve 95% match coverage with processing speed under 60 seconds for monthly batches.

**Avoid (Vague)**:
> The system should be fast and accurate.

## Specification Lifecycle

### Creation

1. **Start with problem statement**: Clearly define what problem the system solves
2. **Define success criteria**: Establish measurable goals
3. **Outline functional requirements**: Describe inputs, processing, and outputs
4. **Review existing patterns**: Follow established architectural approaches

### Maintenance

1. **Update after major features**: Reflect new capabilities in the specification
2. **Revise success criteria**: Update metrics based on actual performance
3. **Add lessons learned**: Incorporate insights from implementation
4. **Remove outdated content**: Keep specifications current and relevant

### Version Control

- **Track major changes** in the document history section
- **Use semantic versioning** (1.0, 1.1, 2.0) for significant updates
- **Update status field** to reflect current development state

## File Naming Convention

Use the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-system-name.md`

Examples:
- `2025-09-21-amazon-transaction-matching.md`
- `2025-09-21-cash-flow-analysis.md`
- `2025-09-14-apple-transaction-matching.md`

## Quality Standards

### Technical Accuracy

- **Verify current implementation** aligns with specification content
- **Test described features** to ensure specifications reflect reality
- **Update performance metrics** based on actual system benchmarks

### Documentation Quality

- **Use consistent terminology** throughout the document
- **Include specific examples** where helpful for clarity
- **Cross-reference related specifications** when appropriate
- **Maintain professional formatting** and structure

### Review Process

- **Validate with implementation** to ensure specifications match reality
- **Review for clarity** and completeness
- **Check for consistency** with other specifications
- **Update regularly** as the system evolves

This guide ensures specifications serve as reliable, current documentation of system capabilities while maintaining consistency across all technical documentation in the repository.
