# Code Quality and Development Tooling Specification

**Created:** 2025-09-21
**Status:** Proposed
**Type:** Development Standards

## Overview

Establish comprehensive code quality standards and automated development tooling for
  the personal finance management package to ensure maintainable, reliable, and
  professional-grade code throughout the project lifecycle.

## Goals

Establish practical code quality standards for the personal finance management package
  using industry-standard Python tooling:

- **Automated Quality Checks**: Fast pre-commit hooks for local development, comprehensive
  CI/CD checks for pull requests
- **Consistent Code Style**: Unified formatting (Black) and linting (Ruff) across entire
  codebase
- **Type Safety**: Complete type annotations for project code with pragmatic dependency
  handling
- **Test Quality**: 60% coverage focused on valuable, meaningful tests over metrics
- **Security**: GitHub-native secret scanning and Renovate bot for dependency updates
- **Developer Experience**: Fast feedback loops, clear error messages, minimal friction

## Quality Framework

### Code Formatting Standards

- **Black**: Automatic code formatting with 110 character line length
- **Import Sorting**: Automated import organization with isort/ruff
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Enforced through Ruff linting
- **Docstrings**: Consistent style with automated validation

### Static Analysis

- **Ruff**: Fast, comprehensive linting for syntax, style, logic, and security issues
- **Code Quality Checks**: Duplication detection, circular imports, dead code
  identification
- **Incremental Analysis**: Only check modified files for performance

### Type Safety Standards

#### Type Coverage Goals
- **Project Code**: Complete type annotation coverage for all project code
- **Public APIs**: All public functions, classes, and methods must have type annotations
- **Mypy Strict Mode**: Use strict mypy configuration for project code validation
- **Pragmatic Boundaries**: Accept incomplete types at dependency boundaries
  - Use type stubs where available from typeshed or package maintainers
  - Use `type: ignore` with comments for unavoidable gaps in third-party code
  - Don't create extensive custom stubs for untyped dependencies

#### Financial Domain Types
- **Currency Types**: Strict typing for milliunits, cents, and monetary calculations
- **Transaction Models**: Comprehensive type definitions for financial data structures
- **API Contracts**: Type-safe interfaces for external service integration
- **Configuration Types**: Typed configuration objects with validation

### Testing Quality Standards

#### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Target Coverage**: 60% line and branch coverage for production code
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on valuable, meaningful tests over coverage metrics
- **Critical Path Coverage**: 100% coverage for financial calculations and data integrity
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive end-to-end tests with realistic data fixtures

#### Testing Philosophy
- **Integration First**: Prefer end-to-end tests with canned mock data over excessive
  unit testing
- **Minimal Mocking**: Design code for testability without requiring heavy mock usage
  - High mock usage often indicates poor design or low-value tests
  - Use real implementations with test data when practical
- **Meaningful Assertions**: Every test must validate real behavior, not implementation
  details
- **Test Maintainability**: Tests should be clear, focused, and easy to understand

#### Test Organization
- **Structure**: Test organization mirrors source code structure
- **Fixtures**: Reusable test data and setup patterns in conftest.py
- **Categories**: Unit tests for complex logic, integration tests for workflows
- **Documentation**: Clear test names and docstrings explain purpose

## Development Workflow Integration

### Pre-Commit Quality Gates

#### Fast Local Validation (<2 seconds)
- **Formatting**: Automatic Black formatting on commit
- **Import Sorting**: Automated import organization with isort/ruff
- **Basic Linting**: Fast ruff checks for syntax errors and obvious issues

#### Quality Feedback Loop
- **Immediate Feedback**: Pre-commit hooks provide instant quality assessment
- **Auto-Fix**: Automatic correction of formatting and import issues
- **Minimal Friction**: Fast execution keeps development flow smooth
- **Bypass Available**: Use `--no-verify` for legitimate exceptions

**Note**: Comprehensive checks (full linting, type checking, tests) run in GitHub
  Actions to maintain fast local workflow.

## Considerations

### Development Workflow
- **Local Performance**: Pre-commit hooks must be <2 seconds to avoid friction
- **CI/CD Efficiency**: GitHub Actions runs comprehensive checks without blocking
  development
- **Tool Maintenance**: Renovate bot automates dependency updates; manual review for
  breaking changes
- **Configuration**: Centralized in pyproject.toml and .pre-commit-config.yaml with
  version control

### Incremental Adoption
- **Legacy Code**: Apply quality standards gradually to existing code through refactoring
- **Quality Improvements**: Fix issues as you touch code, don't require perfect compliance
  immediately
- **Pragmatic Exceptions**: Use `# type: ignore`, `# noqa`, etc. with comments when
  necessary
- **Regression Prevention**: Quality gates prevent new issues from entering codebase
