# Cash Flow Analysis System - Product Specification

## Executive Summary

The Cash Flow Analysis System provides comprehensive financial dashboard generation
  and trend analysis for the Davis family's cash and liquid accounts.
It transforms raw YNAB transaction data into visual insights including moving
  averages, volatility analysis, trend projections, and financial health metrics to
  support informed budgeting and spending decisions.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
1. **Limited Financial Visibility**: YNAB provides transaction-level detail but lacks
     comprehensive cash flow trend analysis
2. **Manual Analysis Burden**: Understanding spending patterns, seasonal trends, and
     financial health requires manual spreadsheet work
3. **Missing Context**: Individual transactions don't reveal broader financial
     patterns or trajectory
4. **No Predictive Insights**: Inability to project future cash flow based on
     historical trends
5. **Volatility Blindness**: Difficult to understand balance fluctuation patterns and
     what drives them
6. **Multi-Account Complexity**: Five different accounts need unified analysis to
     understand total financial picture

### Business Impact
- **Decision Making**: Limited visibility into whether spending patterns are
    sustainable
- **Budget Planning**: Cannot identify seasonal patterns or cyclical spending
    behaviors
- **Risk Assessment**: No early warning system for negative cash flow trends
- **Goal Setting**: Difficult to set realistic financial targets without historical
    context
- **Performance Tracking**: No quantitative way to measure financial health
    improvement over time

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
1. **Comprehensive Visualization**: Generate multi-faceted dashboard showing all key
     financial metrics
2. **Trend Analysis**: Identify and quantify financial trajectory with statistical
     confidence
3. **Automated Insights**: Extract actionable insights without manual analysis
4. **Historical Context**: Process all available reliable financial data for complete
     picture
5. **Repeatable Analysis**: Enable regular dashboard generation for ongoing
     monitoring

### Measurable Outcomes
- **Dashboard Generation**: Complete analysis in <30 seconds
- **Data Coverage**: Process all transactions since May 2024 (reliable data cutoff)
- **Visual Clarity**: 6-panel dashboard covering all major financial dimensions
- **Statistical Accuracy**: Trend analysis with confidence intervals and validation
    metrics

## Technical Architecture

### Current Implementation (Flow System Integration)

**Modern Implementation:**
The Cash Flow Analysis System is integrated into the Financial Flow System as **CashFlowNode**.

```bash
# Execute cash flow analysis via flow system
finances flow

# The flow system:
# - Prompts for cash flow analysis update
# - Depends on YnabDataNode (requires YNAB data)
# - Uses CashFlowAnalyzer with CashFlowDataStore
# - Generates 6-panel dashboard automatically
# - Outputs to data/cash_flow/charts/
```

**DataStore Pattern:**
- **CashFlowDataStore**: Manages cash flow analysis results and dashboards
- **Location**: `data/cash_flow/` directory
- **Charts**: Timestamped PNG files with 6-panel dashboards
- **Archiving**: Previous dashboards maintained for trend comparison
- **Configuration**: Account selection and date ranges via environment variables

**Code Organization:**
The Python analysis code described below is implemented in `src/finances/analysis/cash_flow.py`
  and integrated into the flow system.
The architectural patterns and statistical methods remain as specified.

### Data Pipeline Design

#### Phase 1: Data Loading and Validation
```python
# Load YNAB data with error handling
accounts_data = load_json('ynab-data/accounts.json')
transactions = load_json('ynab-data/transactions.json')

# Validate required fields and data quality
validate_account_data(accounts_data)
validate_transaction_data(transactions)
```

#### Phase 2: Balance Reconstruction
```python
# Filter to cash accounts and reliable date range
cash_transactions = filter_transactions(
    transactions,
    accounts=CASH_ACCOUNTS,
    start_date='2024-05-01'
)

# Reconstruct daily balances working backwards
daily_balances = reconstruct_balances(
    cash_transactions,
    current_balances
)
```

#### Phase 3: Statistical Analysis
```python
# Convert to pandas DataFrame for analysis
df = create_timeseries_dataframe(daily_balances)

# Calculate all moving averages and metrics
df = add_moving_averages(df, windows=[7, 30, 90])
df = add_trend_analysis(df)
df = add_volatility_metrics(df)
```

#### Phase 4: Visualization Generation
```python
# Create comprehensive 6-panel dashboard
fig = create_dashboard_layout(figsize=(16, 12))
plots = generate_all_panels(df, monthly_stats)
save_timestamped_dashboard(fig, 'results/')
```

### Statistical Methods

#### Trend Analysis
- **Method**: Linear regression using scipy.stats.linregress
- **Confidence**: R-squared correlation coefficient
- **Projections**: Slope-based daily/monthly/yearly extrapolations
- **Validation**: Statistical significance testing

#### Smoothing Techniques
- **Simple Moving Averages**: Unweighted rolling windows (7, 30, 90 days)
- **Purpose**: Noise reduction and pattern identification
- **Implementation**: Pandas rolling() with minimum periods handling

#### Volatility Calculations
- **Standard Deviation**: Population standard deviation of daily balances
- **Coefficient of Variation**: Normalized volatility metric (std/mean)
- **Range Analysis**: Monthly high-low spread for stability assessment

### Performance Characteristics

#### Processing Speed
- **Target**: Complete analysis in <30 seconds
- **Current**: ~5-10 seconds for 150+ days of data
- **Scalability**: Linear with transaction volume
