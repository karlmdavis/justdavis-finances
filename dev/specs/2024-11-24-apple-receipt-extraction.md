# Apple Receipt Email Extraction System - Product Specification

## Executive Summary

The Apple Receipt Email Extraction System addresses the challenge of categorizing Apple App Store,
  iTunes, and other Apple service purchases within YNAB (You Need A Budget).
Apple consolidates multiple purchases into single credit card transactions, making it impossible to
  properly categorize individual items without access to the detailed receipt information sent via
  email.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
1. **Opaque Transaction Data**: Apple charges appear in YNAB as consolidated amounts (e.g.,
     "$45.67 from APPLE.COM/BILL") without itemization.
2. **Manual Categorization Burden**: Users must manually search email receipts to understand what
     was purchased.
3. **Family Sharing Complexity**: Multiple family members' purchases appear as single charges,
     complicating budget allocation.
4. **Historical Data Loss**: Years of purchase history remains uncategorized in YNAB.
5. **Subscription Tracking**: Recurring subscriptions are difficult to identify and track over
     time.

### User Impact
- **Time Cost**: 5-10 minutes per Apple transaction to manually match and categorize.
- **Accuracy Issues**: Purchases often miscategorized or left in generic "Shopping" categories.
- **Budget Insights**: Unable to analyze spending patterns for apps, media, subscriptions
    separately.
- **Family Budgeting**: Cannot allocate costs to appropriate family members.

## Solution Overview

An automated system that extracts Apple receipt emails, parses purchase details, and structures
  the data for matching with YNAB transactionsâ€”similar to the existing Amazon transaction matching
  system but tailored for Apple's unique receipt format and purchase patterns.

## Functional Requirements

### Data Extraction Requirements

#### Email Retrieval
- **Source**: IMAP access to email account (user@example.com).
- **Search Criteria**: Emails with subject "Your receipt from Apple" or similar patterns.
- **Historical Scope**: Extract all available receipts (potentially years of history).
- **Incremental Updates**: Support for fetching only new receipts in future runs.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection issues, malformed emails.

#### Receipt Types to Support
- **App Store Purchases**: iOS and macOS applications.
- **In-App Purchases**: Additional content within apps.
- **Subscriptions**: Recurring charges for services.
- **Media Purchases**: Music, movies, TV shows, books (if same format).
- **iCloud Services**: Storage and other Apple services.
- **Hardware Purchases**: Excluded if format differs significantly.

### Data Parsing Requirements

#### Required Fields per Receipt
1. **Receipt Metadata**
   - Apple Account ID (purchaser's email).
   - Receipt date and time.
   - Order ID (unique identifier).
   - Document/Invoice number.

2. **Financial Information**
   - Subtotal amount.
   - Tax amount.
   - Total amount charged.
   - Currency (if international).

3. **Line Item Details**
   - Product name/title.
   - Product description/subtitle.
   - Purchase type (app, subscription, in-app, etc.).
   - Device/platform (iPhone, Mac, etc.).
   - Individual item cost.
   - Quantity (if applicable).

#### Format Handling
- **Version Detection**: Identify and handle different receipt formats over time.
- **Flexible Parsing**: Adapt to HTML structure variations.
- **Encoding Support**: Handle various character encodings properly.
- **Error Recovery**: Skip unparseable receipts without stopping batch processing.

### Data Export Requirements

#### Output Format
- **Structure**: JSON format for consistency with existing tools.
- **Organization**: Chronologically sorted receipts.
- **Metadata**: Include extraction statistics and date ranges.
- **Validation**: Built-in data integrity checks.

#### Storage Convention
- **Directory Structure**: Follow `apple/data/` pattern similar to Amazon.
- **File Naming**: Timestamped exports (YYYY-MM-DD_apple_receipts.json).
- **Intermediate Storage**: Cached .eml files for re-processing.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Batch Processing**: Handle hundreds of emails efficiently.
- **Resumable**: Support interruption and resume of long extraction runs.
- **Caching**: Store intermediate results to avoid re-processing.

### Reliability
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for transient failures.
- **Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging and audit trail.
- **Validation**: Automated checks for data consistency.

### Maintainability
- **Modular Design**: Separate components for fetch, parse, export.
- **Format Evolution**: Easy to add new receipt format parsers.
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation of receipt formats and parsing logic.

### Security
- **Credential Management**: Environment variables for email credentials.
- **Data Privacy**: No logging of sensitive purchase details.
- **Local Processing**: All data processing happens locally.

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Coverage**: Successfully parse >95% of Apple receipt emails.
- **Accuracy**: 100% accuracy in amount extraction for parsed receipts.
- **Performance**: Process 100 receipts in <30 seconds.
- **Historical Reach**: Extract receipts dating back at least 3 years.

### Qualitative Goals
- **User Experience**: Simple command-line interface matching existing tools.
- **Integration Ready**: Output format compatible with future YNAB matching.
- **Debugging Support**: Clear error messages and validation reports.
- **Extensibility**: Architecture supports adding new Apple services.

## Integration Points

### Upstream Dependencies
- **Email Service**: IMAP access to email provider.
- **Apple Receipt Format**: HTML email structure from Apple.

### Downstream Consumers
- **YNAB Transaction Matcher**: Future system to match receipts with transactions.
- **Financial Analysis Tools**: Spending pattern analysis scripts.
- **Budget Reports**: Category allocation and trending.

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- **Email Access**: Requires IMAP credentials and server support.
- **Receipt Format**: Assumes Apple maintains parseable HTML structure.
- **Local Storage**: Sufficient disk space for email cache.

### Business Assumptions
- **Receipt Completeness**: All Apple purchases generate email receipts.
- **Single Email Address**: All family receipts arrive at one email account.
- **Format Stability**: Receipt formats change gradually, not drastically.

## Future Enhancements

### Near-term Opportunities
- **Smart Categorization**: Suggest YNAB categories based on purchase type.
- **Subscription Tracking**: Identify and track recurring subscriptions.
- **Family Member Attribution**: Determine which family member made purchase.

### Long-term Vision
- **Real-time Processing**: Process receipts as they arrive.
- **Multi-source Support**: Extend to other digital stores (Google Play, etc.).
- **Automated YNAB Updates**: Direct integration with YNAB API.
