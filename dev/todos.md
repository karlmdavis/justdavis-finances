# Development T-Dos

## Minor Items

- [ ] Add additional Markdown formatting rules to @CONTRIBUTORS.md,
        then apply them to all existing Markdown files:
    - [ ] Every sentence, list item, or other full sentence-like line should end with a period.
    - [ ] Trailing whitespace should be removed from lines,
            except when required by Markdown's formatting rules,
            such as for code blocks inside a list.
    - [ ] Files should end with a line break, per POSIX.
- [ ] Rename the YNAB "mutations" to "edits".
- [ ] JSON file outputs should be pretty-printed, for readability and searchability.

## Major Items

- [ ] Implement @dev/specs/2025-09-21-code-quality.md, to add lints and CI and such.
