# Phase 6: Documentation & Code Cleanup

## Status: üöß IN PROGRESS

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-18

## Goal

Ensure all documentation accurately reflects the completed Phase 1-5 architecture and eliminate
  technical debt from the codebase.

## High-Level Objectives

1. **Audit and update specification files** to reflect the completed flow system and domain models
2. **Create architecture documentation** for new developers
3. **Clean up technical debt** (TODOs, obsolete comments, dead code)
4. **Ensure documentation accuracy** (tested examples, working links, current instructions)

## Problem Statement

**Current state:**
- ‚úÖ README.md is comprehensive and current (documents `finances flow`)
- ‚úÖ CLAUDE.md is up-to-date with Money/FinancialDate and testing philosophy
- ‚úÖ Phase plans documented and marked complete (Phases 1-5)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Specs in `dev/specs/` may reference old command structures or outdated architecture
- ‚ùå No centralized architecture documentation file for developers
- ‚ùå TODOs/FIXMEs not audited or tracked
- ‚ùå CONTRIBUTING.md may need enhancement with developer guides

**Target state:**
- All specifications updated to reflect current architecture (flow system, domain models, DataStores)
- Architecture documentation explains system design for new developers (<1 hour to understand)
- All TODOs either completed, tracked in GitHub issues, or documented as known limitations
- CONTRIBUTING.md includes comprehensive developer guides

## Success Criteria

- New developer can understand system architecture in <1 hour reading docs
- All code examples in documentation are accurate and tested
- No orphaned TODOs in codebase (all tracked or resolved)
- All internal documentation links work correctly
- Specs reflect actual implementation (not aspirational designs)

## Key Changes

### 1. Audit and Update Specifications

**Files to audit** (in `dev/specs/`):
- `2025-09-24-financial-flow-system.md` - Verify reflects current implementation
- `2025-09-21-python-package-restructure.md` - Verify reflects final package structure
- `2025-09-21-amazon-transaction-matching.md` - Verify reflects domain model implementation
- `2025-09-14-apple-transaction-matching.md` - Verify reflects domain model implementation
- `2025-09-20-ynab-transaction-updater.md` - Verify reflects current YNAB integration
- `2025-09-21-amazon-data-workflow.md` - Verify reflects DataStore and flow system
- `2025-09-21-ynab-data-workflow.md` - Verify reflects DataStore and flow system
- `2025-09-21-cash-flow-analysis.md` - Verify reflects current analysis implementation
- Other specs as needed

**Updates needed:**
- Remove references to deprecated multi-command architecture (if any)
- Document Money and FinancialDate primitives in relevant specs
- Document DataStore architecture usage
- Update code examples to reflect current implementations
- Mark obsolete specs as deprecated or archive them

**Audit criteria:**
- Does spec reflect current implementation?
- Are code examples accurate and tested?
- Are command examples current (`finances flow` vs old individual commands)?
- Are domain models documented correctly?

### 2. Create Architecture Documentation

**File:** `dev/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (NEW)

**Content to include:**
- **System Overview**: High-level description of financial flow system
- **Core Concepts**:
  - Flow nodes and dependency graph
  - DataStore pattern for data persistence
  - Domain models and type-safe primitives (Money, FinancialDate)
  - Change detection and archiving
- **Package Structure**: Explain `src/finances/` organization
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: Visual representation of data through system
- **Testing Philosophy**: Link to inverted pyramid documentation
- **Extension Points**: How to add new flow nodes, datastores, domain models

**Target audience**: New developers with Python experience but no codebase familiarity

**Success metric**: New developer can understand architecture in <1 hour

### 3. Update CONTRIBUTING.md

**File:** `CONTRIBUTING.md` (enhance existing)

**Add sections:**
- **Adding a New Flow Node**: Step-by-step guide with example
- **Creating a New DataStore**: Pattern and best practices
- **Working with Domain Models**: Money, FinancialDate, and domain-specific models
- **Writing Tests**: E2E ‚Üí Integration ‚Üí Unit approach with examples
- **Debugging the Flow System**: Common issues and solutions
- **Code Quality Tools**: pre-commit hooks, mypy, ruff, black usage

**Keep existing sections:**
- PR workflow and success criteria
- Testing philosophy
- Markdown formatting guidelines

### 4. Clean Up TODOs and Technical Debt

**Strategy:**
1. Search codebase for `TODO`, `FIXME`, `XXX`, `HACK` comments
2. For each item:
   - **Trivial**: Fix immediately in this phase
   - **Important**: Create GitHub issue and reference in comment (`# TODO(#123): ...`)
   - **Obsolete**: Delete the comment
   - **By design**: Move to `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` with explanation

**File:** `dev/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` (update or create)

**Document:**
- Architecture limitations (intentional design constraints)
- Performance considerations (acceptable trade-offs)
- Edge cases and workarounds (documented behaviors)
- Future enhancement ideas (not TODO, but "nice to have")

**Search commands:**
```bash
# Find all TODOs in source code
rg "TODO|FIXME|XXX|HACK" src/

# Find all TODOs in test code
rg "TODO|FIXME|XXX|HACK" tests/

# Find all TODOs in documentation
rg "TODO|FIXME|XXX|HACK" *.md dev/
```

### 5. Verify Documentation Accuracy

**Tasks:**
1. **Test all code examples** in README.md and CLAUDE.md
2. **Verify all links** work (internal and external)
3. **Check command examples** match actual CLI
4. **Validate import examples** in CLAUDE.md
5. **Spell-check** all documentation files

**Testing checklist:**
- [ ] Run every command in README.md "Basic Usage" section
- [ ] Run every command in "Core Features" sections
- [ ] Verify import statements in CLAUDE.md work
- [ ] Test CLI examples in specification files
- [ ] Verify configuration examples in README.md

**Link verification:**
```bash
# Check internal links in markdown files
# (manual inspection needed)
grep -r "\[.*\](.*.md)" *.md dev/

# Verify files referenced exist
# (check paths in CLAUDE.md, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)
```

### 6. Clean Up Obsolete Files and Directories

**Audit:**
- Check `dev/` for obsolete planning documents
- Remove empty or placeholder files
- Archive superseded specifications

**Candidates for review:**
- `dev/phase-2-type-checking-report.md` - Integrate into Phase 2 plan or archive
- Duplicate/superseded phase plans (keep only final versions)
- Old reports that are no longer relevant
