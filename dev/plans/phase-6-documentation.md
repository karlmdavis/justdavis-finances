# Phase 6: Documentation & Code Cleanup

## Status: üöß IN PROGRESS

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-18

## Goal

Ensure all documentation accurately reflects the completed Phase 1-5 architecture and eliminate
  technical debt from the codebase through a layered discovery-first approach.

## High-Level Objectives

1. **Discover current state** through TODO and specification audits
2. **Create architecture documentation** informed by discovery findings
3. **Clean up technical debt** with GitHub issue tracking infrastructure
4. **Ensure documentation accuracy** through comprehensive verification

## Approach

Phase 6 follows a **3-phase layered approach**:
- **Phase 1: Discovery & Understanding** - Audit what exists, identify gaps
- **Phase 2: Documentation Creation** - Build on discovery insights
- **Phase 3: Polish & Cleanup** - Execute migrations and verify quality

This approach ensures that discovery findings inform all documentation creation work.

## Problem Statement

**Current state:**
- ‚úÖ README.md is comprehensive and current (documents `finances flow`)
- ‚úÖ CLAUDE.md is up-to-date with Money/FinancialDate and testing philosophy
- ‚úÖ Phase plans documented and marked complete (Phases 1-5)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Specs in `dev/specs/` may reference old command structures or outdated architecture
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Loose documentation files: `YNAB_DATA_WORKFLOW.md`, `dev/phase-2-type-checking-report.md`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO tracking files exist but not integrated: `dev/todos.md`, `todos.md`, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`
- ‚ùå No centralized architecture documentation file for developers
- ‚ùå TODOs/FIXMEs not audited or tracked in GitHub
- ‚ùå No GitHub issue templates for structured issue tracking
- ‚ùå CONTRIBUTING.md lacks developer guides for common tasks

**Target state:**
- All specifications updated to reflect current architecture (flow system, domain models, DataStores)
- Architecture documentation explains system design for new developers (<1 hour to understand)
- All TODOs tracked in GitHub issues with appropriate templates
- CONTRIBUTING.md includes comprehensive developer guides
- All loose documentation files migrated to appropriate locations
- Clean, organized documentation structure

## Success Criteria

- New developer can understand system architecture in <1 hour reading docs
- All code examples in documentation are accurate and tested
- Zero orphaned TODOs in codebase (all tracked in GitHub issues)
- All internal documentation links work correctly
- Specs reflect actual implementation (not aspirational designs)
- GitHub issue templates support structured issue tracking
- All markdown files follow formatting guidelines

## Phase 1: Discovery & Understanding

### Task 1: TODO Audit and Catalog
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 2-3 hours

**Objectives:**
- Catalog all TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK comments in codebase
- Audit existing TODO tracking files
- Categorize findings for later processing
- Identify documentation gaps revealed by TODOs

**Activities:**
1. Search codebase for TODO-style comments:
   ```bash
   rg "TODO|FIXME|XXX|HACK" src/
   rg "TODO|FIXME|XXX|HACK" tests/
   rg "TODO|FIXME|XXX|HACK" *.md dev/
   ```
2. Audit existing TODO files:
   - `dev/todos.md` - Review all items
   - `todos.md` - Review all items
   - `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` - Review all items
3. Categorize each finding:
   - **Trivial**: Can be fixed immediately
   - **Important**: Needs GitHub issue tracking
   - **Obsolete**: No longer relevant, can be deleted
   - **By design**: Intentional limitation, needs documentation
4. Create catalog document: `dev/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-todo-audit.md`

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Comprehensive TODO catalog with all findings categorized
- [ ] List of documentation gaps revealed by TODOs
- [ ] Clear plan for which TODOs become GitHub issues vs fixed vs deleted

### Task 2: Specification and Documentation Audit
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3-4 hours

**Objectives:**
- Identify outdated or incorrect documentation
- Understand what's implemented vs documented
- Plan content migration for loose documentation files
- Assess current GitHub issue template status

**Activities:**
1. Audit all specs in `dev/specs/`:
   - `2025-09-24-financial-flow-system.md` - Verify reflects current implementation
   - `2025-09-21-python-package-restructure.md` - Verify reflects final package structure
   - `2025-09-21-amazon-transaction-matching.md` - Verify reflects domain model implementation
   - `2025-09-14-apple-transaction-matching.md` - Verify reflects domain model implementation
   - `2025-09-20-ynab-transaction-updater.md` - Verify reflects current YNAB integration
   - `2025-09-21-amazon-data-workflow.md` - Verify reflects DataStore and flow system
   - `2025-09-21-ynab-data-workflow.md` - Verify reflects DataStore and flow system
   - `2025-09-21-cash-flow-analysis.md` - Verify reflects current analysis implementation
   - Other specs as needed

2. For each spec, document:
   - Current accuracy status
   - Sections that need updating
   - Code examples that need testing
   - Command examples that need updating

3. Audit loose documentation files:
   - `YNAB_DATA_WORKFLOW.md` - Identify where content should migrate (architecture vs contributing)
   - `dev/phase-2-type-checking-report.md` - Plan relocation to `dev/reports/` with date stamp

4. Review GitHub issue template needs:
   - Check if `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` exists
   - Identify what templates are needed (maintenance, bug, user story)

5. Create findings document: `dev/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-documentation-audit.md`

**Audit criteria for specs:**
- Does spec reflect current implementation?
- Are code examples accurate and tested?
- Are command examples current (`finances flow` vs old individual commands)?
- Are domain models documented correctly?
- Should spec be updated or marked as deprecated?

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Audit findings document with recommendations for each spec
- [ ] Content migration plan for `YNAB_DATA_WORKFLOW.md` (which sections go where)
- [ ] Date identified for `phase-2-type-checking-report.md` relocation
- [ ] List of GitHub issue templates to create
