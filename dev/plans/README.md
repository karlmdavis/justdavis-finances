# Implementation Plans

This directory contains detailed implementation plans for the justdavis-finances system.

## Directory Structure

- **consolidation-2024/** - Completed 2024 system consolidation and modernization initiative
- Individual plan files for future work go here at the top level

## Consolidation 2024 Initiative

The 2024 consolidation initiative addressed fundamental quality issues that emerged before
  the first release:
- Far too many CLI commands with excessive options
- Brittle integration points causing test failures
- Inconsistent type handling (especially currency and dates)
- Tests coupled to implementation details rather than behavior
- Data format mismatches between components

These issues led to a multi-PR cycle of yo-yo fixes where addressing one problem would
  break something else.

### Approach: Top-Down Refactoring

The consolidation took a **top-down approach**:
1. Lock in the UX first (Phase 1)
2. Build type safety (Phase 2)
3. Create consistent infrastructure (Phase 3)
4. Refactor domain models (Phase 4)
5. Improve test quality (Phase 5)
6. Update documentation (Phase 6)

This minimized rework by defining the target interface before refactoring internals.

See [consolidation-2024/](consolidation-2024/) for detailed phase plans.

### Consolidation Summary

**Status:** üü¢ Complete (October 2024)

**Total Effort:** ~125 hours across 6 phases

**Key Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: CLI Simplification (PR #10) - Single `finances flow` command
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Primitive Types (PR #11) - Money and FinancialDate wrappers
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: DataStore Infrastructure (PR #12) - Separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Phase 4: Domain Model Migration (PR #13, #14) - Eliminated DataFrames
- ‚úÖ Phase 5: Test Suite Overhaul (PR #18) - Inverted test pyramid
- ‚úÖ Phase 6: Documentation & Polish (PR #21) - Complete architecture docs

**Results:**
- Zero floating-point currency operations
- No type mismatches at integration points
- ~3 minute test suite execution (357 tests)
- Single command interface (`finances flow`)
- Professional documentation infrastructure

## Future Work

New implementation plans for features, enhancements, and initiatives will be created at the
  top level of this directory.
Plans no longer need to follow the "phase" naming convention - use descriptive names that
  reflect the actual work

---

## Creating Implementation Plans

When creating new implementation plans, include:
- **Goal**: What you're trying to achieve
- **Problem Statement**: Current vs. target state
- **Key Changes**: Detailed implementation notes
- **Testing Strategy**: How to verify it works
- **Definition of Done**: Concrete checklist
- **Estimated Effort**: Time expectations (optional)
- **Dependencies**: What must complete first (if any)

### Recommended Process

1. **Write the plan** - Think through the approach before coding
2. **Create feature branch** for the work
3. **Work through Definition of Done checklist**
4. **Create PR** when complete
5. **Update plan status** when merged

### Plan Naming

Use descriptive names that reflect the actual work:
- ‚úÖ `apple-card-integration.md`
- ‚úÖ `retirement-account-automation.md`
- ‚úÖ `multi-currency-support.md`
- ‚ùå `phase-7-new-feature.md`

## Questions or Concerns?

If you encounter issues or have questions while implementing:
1. Check the relevant spec in `dev/specs/`
2. Review CLAUDE.md for project conventions
3. Review `dev/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design
4. Create a GitHub issue for discussion
5. Update the plan based on learnings
