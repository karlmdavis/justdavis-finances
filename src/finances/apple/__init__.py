Advanced Apple receipt processing and transaction matching with email integration.

This package provides:
- Apple receipt data loading from exported files
- Transaction matching with confidence scoring using 2-strategy system
- Email integration for direct receipt extraction
- Receipt parsing from HTML emails with multiple format support
- 1:1 transaction model optimized for Apple's billing structure

Key Components:
- loader: Apple receipt data loading and normalization
- matcher: Transaction matching with exact + date window strategies
- parser: HTML receipt parsing with format detection
- email_fetcher: IMAP-based email fetching for receipt extraction

Apple's simplified transaction model enables direct matching with high success rates.
Unlike Amazon's complex bundling, Apple typically has 1:1 correspondence between
receipts and credit card transactions.

Transaction Matching Features:
- Exact Match Strategy: Same date + exact amount (confidence 1.0)
- Date Window Strategy: Â±1-2 days with exact amount (confidence 0.75-0.90)
- Multi-Apple ID Support: Handles family accounts with proper attribution
- High Performance: ~0.005 seconds per transaction
- Current Success Rate: 85.1% match rate with 0.871 average confidence

- Email fetching with IMAP support and secure authentication
- Robust data extraction with fallback strategies
- Financial precision with currency handling
